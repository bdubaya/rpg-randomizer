# Locked Data

I want to use rpg-randomizer in github as a simple VSS, but I am also using some proprietary information and do not want that to be public. As such, I have included encrypted json files here with lock/unlock scripts. It's not necessarily best practices but it should prove to be a decent deterrent. If this every becomes a larger application or garners much interest I will revisit this concept.
