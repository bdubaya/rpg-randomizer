# rpg-randomizer
Playing around with python's reflection, still teaching myself the language so it's not super impressive

### Purpose
This Randomizer uses random tables to populate a dungeon for a table-top RPG game. It does this via RandomValues.txt and reflection.

## A Word on the Locked Data
I want to use rpg-randomizer in github as a simple VCS, but I am also using some proprietary information and do not want that to be public. As such, I have included encrypted json files here with lock/unlock scripts. It's not necessarily best practices but it should prove to be a decent deterrent. If this ever becomes a larger application or garners much interest I will revisit this concept
